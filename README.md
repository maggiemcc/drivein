- Reduced clutter.
- Made more responsive.
- Each device view (mobile, tablet, & desktop) now looks and navigates the same. As opposed to the original site.
- Made easier to navigate and find nav / menu items by reducing down to two nav bars (main nav bar & footer menu).
- Put photos all in one place.
